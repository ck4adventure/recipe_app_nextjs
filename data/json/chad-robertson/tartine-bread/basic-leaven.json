		"The night before you plan to make a dough, feed the 1 Tbl starter with 200g of water and 200g of the 50/50 flour blend. Mix well, cover, and let sit overnight in a cool place, around 65°F (18°C).",
		"The next day, the leaven should be bubbly and active. To test if it's ready, drop a spoonful of the leaven into a bowl of water. If it floats, it's ready to use. If it sinks, let it sit for another hour or so and test again.",
		"200g becomes the usable leaven for the dough, and the other 200g are your new basic starter."
