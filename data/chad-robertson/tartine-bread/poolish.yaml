title: Poolish
category: bread
ingredients:
  - 500 g bread flour
  - 500 g water
  - 7 g instant yeast
steps:
  - In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, water, and yeast.
  - Stir until well mixed, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let it sit in a cool place overnight (8-12 hours), or until it passes the drop test.
  - When ready, the poolish will be bubbly and active. To test if it's ready, drop a spoonful of the poolish into a bowl of water. If it floats, it's ready to use. If it sinks, let it sit for another hour or so and test again.
