# Vegan & Gluten-Free Tahini Thumbprint Cookies

Makes about 12 small cookies

## Ingredients
- 1 ¾ cups (175g) blanched almond flour  
- ¼ tsp fine sea salt  
- ¼ cup (60g) tahini (runny consistency)  
- 3 tbsp (45ml) maple syrup  
- 1 tbsp (15ml) olive oil  
- 1 tsp vanilla extract *(optional but recommended)*  
- ~¼ cup fruit jam (raspberry, strawberry, or apricot)

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the almond flour and salt.

3. In a separate bowl, mix tahini, maple syrup, olive oil, and vanilla (if using) until smooth.

4. Stir the wet ingredients into the dry using a spatula or your hands until a soft dough forms. Dough should be moist but hold together.

5. Scoop 1 tablespoon of dough and roll into balls. Place on baking sheet with a little space between.

6. Gently press a thumbprint or the back of a teaspoon into each ball to create an indentation.

7. Fill each indentation with about ½ teaspoon of jam.

8. Bake for 10–12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Cookies will be soft — they firm up as they cool.

9. Let cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.

## Storage
- Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 3 days.
- Refrigerate for up to a week.

## Notes
- If your tahini is thick, warm it slightly before mixing.
- Try with date paste or chocolate ganache instead of jam for variations.
