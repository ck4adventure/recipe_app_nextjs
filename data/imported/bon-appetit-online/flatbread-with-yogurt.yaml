ingredients:
  - 1/2 c whole wheat flour
  - 1/3 c all purpose flour
  - 3/4 tsp salt
  - 1/4 tsp baking powder
  - 1/2 c whole milk yogurt

steps:
  - Whisk dry ingredients together in a medium bowl. Add yogurt and stir until combined and starting to form a ball. Transfer dough to a clean work surface and knead until mostly smooth, about 1 minute. Divide into 2 to 4 pieces and wrap with plastic. Let rest 15 minutes to let dough relax.
  - Working one at a time, roll out dough on a lightly floured surface, sprinkling dough with flour as needed to prevent sticking, to about 1/8" thick.
  - Heat a medium cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Cook flatbread until underside is golden brown and puffy with a few charred spots, about 2 minutes. Turn and cook on other side until golden brown, about 1 minute. Transfer to a plate, then repeat with remaining dough.
