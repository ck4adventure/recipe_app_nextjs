ingredients:
  - 1/2lb butter
  - 1/2lb flour
  - 1/2 tsp salt
  - approx 4 oz chilled water
  - [2 tsp lemon juice]
steps:
  - Equal parts butter and flour by weight (ie 114g).
  - Start by forming the butter into an oblong, and set that to chill in the fridge.
  - Mix the flour and salt and form into trough on counter. Slowly mix in the chilled water and form into a slightly moist smooth ball, about 2mins quick kneading. Form into a rectangle and chill 15min or so. 
  - Make the pastry packet of dough wrapped around butter. Then do the 6 turns. 
  - Roll out into big square (3/16 in thick) and chill again before cutting, chill again after cutting if it takes too long.

tips:
  - I've experimented with different wrapping methods while chilling the dough, plastic wrap does leave the outside a bit moist, but that is preferable to the dough drying out, especially if not working on 20min cycles.
  - If chilled overnight, make sure to allow a few minutes for the dough to rise slightly in temp or it may crack, especially in the first couple of turns.
  - A hot knife is crucial for cutting and leaving the edge layers open.
  - Prefer a moist dough to a too dry one, but if too moist you end up using a lot of flour each time you roll it out for folding. 
  - I got concerned about the math of the size of the rectangle, 3 times long as it is wide makes a nice square when folded that keeps me nicely consistent(ish) in size
  - Twisty pieces take much longer to bake
