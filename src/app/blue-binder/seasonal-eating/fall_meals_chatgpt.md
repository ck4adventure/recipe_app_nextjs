## 🍲 Meal 2: Autumn Turkey & Sweet Potato Skillet (~950 cal)

Ingredients
- 7 oz ground turkey or turkey breast – 260 cal
- 1 cup diced sweet potato, roasted or pan-seared – 180 cal
- 1 cup sautéed kale or spinach – 60 cal
- 1 cup cooked farro or barley – 220 cal
- 1 Tbsp butter or olive oil – 120 cal
- 2 Tbsp cranberries or dried cherries – 70 cal

Sprinkle of thyme, rosemary, salt, pepper

### Directions

Roast or pan-sear diced sweet potatoes until browned.
In another pan, cook ground turkey with herbs and salt.
Stir in kale or spinach just until wilted.
Combine with farro, cranberries, and butter — toss while warm.

✅ Savory, grounding, perfectly autumnal. Sweet-tart cranberries balance the richness of the butter and turkey.

#### Protein Rotations 
Salmon (omega-3 boost) with roasted Brussels sprouts
Chicken thighs (juicier, more flavorful than breast)
Lentils or white beans (plant-based, fiber-rich)
Pork tenderloin with apples and sage

#### Green Swaps

Swiss chard
Collard greens
Arugula (add at end for peppery bite)
Roasted broccoli

#### Variations on the fruit added

🍎 Diced Apple (fresh)

⅓ medium apple, diced (~½ cup or 60–70 g)
~60 calories

Adds light crunch and brightness — great if you cook it a minute in the turkey skillet to soften slightly.

🌰 Dates (chopped)

1 large Medjool date or 2 small Deglet Noor dates, chopped (~25 g)
~65–70 calories

Deep caramel sweetness; pairs nicely with a sprinkle of rosemary or a dash of vinegar for balance.

🍑 Dried Apricots (chopped)

3 medium apricots, chopped (~30 g)
~70 calories

Mildly tart and chewy; you can soak them in a splash of warm water or broth first if you like them softer.

🌿 Savory/Umami Alternatives

Caramelized onions – add depth and a touch of sweetness naturally

Balsamic glaze drizzle – mimics the sweet-tart effect

Sun-dried tomatoes – adds tangy richness without sweetness

A squeeze of lemon juice + toasted walnuts – gives brightness and texture
