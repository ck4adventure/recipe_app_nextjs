## The Story

This isn't just a sandwich—it's an experience. Creamy, buttery brie meets peppery arugula and lean turkey, all nestled between hearty homemade bread with a nutty flax crunch.

## Flax Wheat Bread Recipe

**Makes 1 loaf (12-14 slices)**

### Ingredients:
- 2 cups whole wheat flour (or 1½ cups whole wheat + ½ cup all-purpose)
- ½ cup ground flaxseed
- 1½ tsp active dry yeast
- 1 Tbsp honey
- 1 tsp salt
- 1¼ cups warm water (110°F)
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 2 Tbsp whole flax seeds (for topping)

### Directions:

1. **Activate yeast:** In a small bowl, combine warm water, honey, and yeast. Let sit 5-10 minutes until foamy.

2. **Mix dry ingredients:** In a large bowl, whisk together flour, ground flaxseed, and salt.

3. **Combine:** Pour yeast mixture and olive oil into dry ingredients. Stir until a shaggy dough forms.

4. **Knead:** Turn out onto a floured surface and knead 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic (or use a stand mixer with dough hook for 5-6 minutes).

5. **First rise:** Place in an oiled bowl, cover with a damp towel, and let rise in a warm spot for 1 hour or until doubled.

6. **Shape:** Punch down dough, shape into a loaf, and place in a greased 9x5" loaf pan. Brush top with water and sprinkle with whole flax seeds.

7. **Second rise:** Cover and let rise 30-45 minutes until dough rises above the pan edge.

8. **Bake:** Preheat oven to 375°F. Bake 35-40 minutes until golden and hollow-sounding when tapped. Internal temp should reach 190°F.

9. **Cool:** Remove from pan and cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.

**Storage:** Keeps 4-5 days at room temperature, or slice and freeze for up to 3 months.

---

## Assembly

1. **Toast the bread lightly** (optional but recommended—brings out the nuttiness).

2. **Spread mustard** on both slices.

3. **Layer bottom slice:** Arugula first (protects bread from getting soggy), then turkey, then brie.

4. **Add extras:** If using apple slices, tuck them between turkey and brie. If using fig jam, spread it on the brie before closing.

5. **Top and press gently.** Cut in half on the diagonal because it matters.

---

## Variations

**Mediterranean:** Swap brie for fresh mozzarella, add sun-dried tomatoes and basil

**Autumn Harvest:** Add thin pear slices and a handful of baby spinach instead of arugula

**Savory Depth:** Add caramelized onions and swap Dijon for whole grain mustard with herbs

**Protein Boost:** Add 1 sliced hard-boiled egg (+70 cal, +6g protein)

This is the meal that does the quiet, unsexy work of keeping your body humming—gut health, steady energy, glowing skin, strong bones. But it tastes so good, you'd eat it even if it didn't.

## Sunday Afternoon Batch Prep (Makes 4-5 Bowls)

**Total active time:** 20 minutes  
**Total time:** 1 hour

### Step 1: Cook the Lentils (15 min active, 25 min total)

1. Rinse 2 cups dry lentils (green or brown—they hold their shape better).
2. Combine in a pot with 5 cups water or broth and a bay leaf.
3. Bring to a boil, reduce to simmer, cook 20-25 minutes until tender but not mushy.
4. Drain, remove bay leaf, season with salt and a drizzle of olive oil.
5. **Store:** Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5 days, or freeze portions for up to 3 months.

### Step 2: Roast the Vegetables (10 min active, 30-35 min total)

1. **Preheat oven to 425°F.** Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment.

2. **Prep vegetables:**
   - 4 cups cauliflower florets
   - 4 cups carrots (halved lengthwise, then cut into 3" pieces)
   - 2 cups red bell pepper strips
   - Optional: Brussels sprouts, butternut squash, beets

3. **Toss each vegetable separately** with olive oil (about 1 Tbsp per 2 cups veg), salt, and pepper. Keep them separate on the pans—they cook at different rates.

4. **Roasting times:**
   - Carrots: 30-35 minutes (flip halfway)
   - Cauliflower: 25-30 minutes (flip halfway)
   - Bell peppers: 20-25 minutes

5. **Look for:** Deep caramelization and charred edges. Don't be shy—this is where the flavor lives.

6. **Store:** Refrigerate in separate containers for up to 5 days.

### Step 3: Make the Tahini Drizzle (5 minutes)

1. Whisk together tahini, lemon juice, minced garlic, and salt.
2. Add water 1 tablespoon at a time until it's pourable but still thick.
3. Taste and adjust—more lemon for brightness, more garlic for punch.
4. **Store:** In a jar in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. It will thicken—just stir in water to loosen.

### Step 4: Toast the Seeds (3 minutes)

1. Heat a dry skillet over medium heat.
2. Add pumpkin or sunflower seeds and toast 3-4 minutes, stirring constantly, until fragrant and lightly golden.
3. **Store:** In an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.

---

## Daily Assembly (5 minutes)

1. **Reheat lentils** in the microwave (1-2 minutes) or enjoy cold.
2. **Reheat vegetables** if desired (1 minute in microwave, or eat at room temp).
3. **Build the bowl:** Lentils as base, arrange vegetables around, sprinkle with feta and seeds.
4. **Drizzle generously** with tahini sauce.
5. **Finish:** Fresh herbs, squeeze of lemon, crack of pepper, pinch of za'atar.

## Crispy Roasted Chickpeas (Lentil Substitute)

### Why Swap?
Chickpeas give you that addictive crispy-crunchy texture while maintaining the plant protein. They're slightly higher in calories but also more satisfying. Perfect if you want the bowl to feel more like a "salad with croutons" vibe.

### Nutritional Comparison (per 1 cup cooked):
- **Lentils:** 230 cal, 18g protein, 16g fiber
- **Chickpeas (before roasting):** 270 cal, 15g protein, 12g fiber
- **Add roasting oil:** +120 cal (1 Tbsp olive oil for the batch)

**Per serving (⅔ cup roasted chickpeas):** ~210 cal, 10g protein

### Ingredients (makes 3 servings)
- 1 can (15 oz) chickpeas, or 2 cups cooked from dry
- 1 Tbsp olive oil
- ½ tsp salt
- Spices (choose your flavor profile below)

### Directions

1. **Dry them thoroughly** (this is the secret to crispiness):
   - Drain and rinse chickpeas
   - Pat completely dry with paper towels or a clean kitchen towel
   - Let them air dry for 10-15 minutes if you have time
   - Optional: Remove loose skins (they get extra crispy without them, but not necessary)

2. **Preheat oven to 400°F.** Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

3. **Toss with oil and salt.** Spread in a single layer—don't overcrowd or they'll steam instead of crisp.

4. **Roast 25-35 minutes:**
   - Shake the pan every 10 minutes for even browning
   - They're done when golden-brown and crunchy on the outside
   - They'll crisp up more as they cool

5. **Add spices in the last 2-3 minutes** (or toss after removing from oven). Adding too early can cause burning.

6. **Cool completely before storing.** They'll continue to crisp as they cool.

### Flavor Profiles

**Za'atar & Lemon (Middle Eastern):**
- 1 tsp za'atar
- ½ tsp garlic powder
- Zest of ½ lemon

**Smoky Paprika:**
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- ½ tsp cumin
- ¼ tsp cayenne (optional)

**Curry Spiced:**
- 1 tsp curry powder
- ½ tsp turmeric
- ¼ tsp ginger powder

**Simply Garlic & Herb:**
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- ½ tsp dried oregano or rosemary
- Fresh cracked black pepper

**Sweet & Savory (Autumn):**
- ½ tsp cinnamon
- ¼ tsp nutmeg
- Pinch of cayenne
- (Add 1 tsp maple syrup with the oil—watch closely, they can burn)

### Storage & Reheating

**Storage:** Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 2-3 days. They will lose some crispiness in the fridge.

**Recrisp:** Spread on a baking sheet and reheat at 350°F for 5-7 minutes.

**Meal prep note:** For best texture, roast chickpeas the same day or day before eating. They're still good after 3 days, just chewier rather than crunchy.

### Pro Tips

- **The drier, the crispier:** This is non-negotiable. Wet chickpeas = steamed chickpeas = sad chickpeas.
- **Don't overcrowd:** Use two pans if needed.
- **Parchment is your friend:** Prevents sticking and makes cleanup easy.
- **Be patient:** They need the full roasting time. Under-roasted chickpeas are chalky.
- **Eat them warm:** They're at peak crispiness right out of the oven.

### Using in the Bowl

Replace the lentils entirely with ⅔-1 cup roasted chickpeas, or use half lentils/half chickpeas for textural variety. The crispy chickpeas add a "crouton" element that makes the bowl feel more dynamic.

They also make an incredible snack on their own—double or triple the batch and thank yourself later.

## **Quinoa Power Bowl Variation**

**Why Quinoa?**
Quinoa is a complete protein (all 9 essential amino acids), cooks faster than lentils, and has a light, fluffy texture that feels less heavy. Perfect if you want the bowl to feel more like a grain bowl than a legume bowl.

**Nutritional Comparison (per 1 cup cooked):**
- **Lentils:** 230 cal, 18g protein, 16g fiber
- **Quinoa:** 220 cal, 8g protein, 5g fiber

**To maintain protein:** Use 1 cup cooked quinoa + ½ cup cooked lentils, or add an extra egg/more feta

**Cooking Quinoa (makes 3 cups cooked):**

1. **Rinse 1 cup dry quinoa** in a fine-mesh strainer (removes bitter coating)
2. Combine with 2 cups water or broth in a pot
3. Bring to a boil, reduce to low simmer, cover
4. Cook 15 minutes until water is absorbed
5. Remove from heat, let sit covered 5 minutes
6. Fluff with a fork

**Storage:** Refrigerate up to 5 days, or freeze portions up to 3 months

**Flavor boost:** Cook quinoa in vegetable broth, or add a bay leaf and garlic clove to the cooking water

**Assembly tip:** Quinoa absorbs dressing beautifully—toss it with half the tahini sauce while still warm, then add vegetables and remaining sauce on top.

## Meal Prep Pro Tips

**The 4-Container System:**
1. Lentils (or grain)
2. Mixed roasted vegetables
3. Tahini sauce in a jar
4. Toppings (seeds, feta, herbs)

**Make it last:**
- Vegetables stay crispest when stored separately and reheated briefly
- Don't dress the salad until serving
- Freeze extra lentils in 1-cup portions
- Double the tahini sauce—you'll use it on everything

**Time savers:**
- Use a mandoline for even vegetable cuts (they roast more evenly)
- Roast vegetables while doing other Sunday tasks
- Make extra bread on the weekend and freeze sliced
