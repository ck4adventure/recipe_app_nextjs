## Upcoming Features
#### Note
Due to wanting to publish this project without auth, removing all db interaction and leaving this as more of a static site with cool react features. Recipes are easily managed as json/yaml files. Later on I will add auth and bring back direct updates.

### Directions have checkmark boxes to keep your place
As a baker, longer recipes often leave me scanning the same paragraphs over and over to find my place. I want a checkbox to the left of each numbered step that when I check it, it grays out the step so I can know to ignore it. The text for a checked step should be grayed out significantly, but still be readable if I need to confirm my work.
There should be a "clear all" box somewhere with a confirmation modal to reset my progress as needed. 

### Convert between Imperial/US/Metric Units
- store recipes in original units of measure (harder, but more accurate)
- if in metric, no real need (for me) to put in imperial
- toggle button to switch between

### Add a recipe from a text file
### Easily Half, Double, Triple... a recipe's quantities
### Cost Calculator
- flour cost per lb (1.30)
- water negligable
- salt negligable
- baking time (gas bill)
### Baking Planner/Scheduler
As a baker, I want to know how long it will take me to get something from start to finish.  
As a baker, I want to know what time it will be done if started at a given time.  
As a baker, I want to know how early I need to start in order to be done by a given time.

## Completed Recipes App Features
### Complex Ingredients
Currently, Ingredients are stored as text unique to the recipe.

When creating a recipe:
I will type in the amount to measure
I will select the unit of measurement from the list
I want to start typing and select the food from the list

This becomes a recipe_ingredient

A food has a name (white bread flour, whole wheat flour, granulated sugar)


### Vercel Postgres
Grrrr. That was a mess until I finally read the error message to the end to see that it was wanting a `POSTGRES_URL` and not the `PG_URL` as given to me by both the UI and CLI `vercel env pull` command. But in the end I have my postico connection, psql if I need it and my scripts to run for seeding.

### Recipe has a Source
I get recipes from books.
I get recipes from the internet.
I get recipes from friends / random one-offs.

#### BE
An author has a name and is_profi? t/f
A source has a type, title, and optional source_url.
A recipe has only one source.
A recipe has only one author. (if multiple needed can switch to joins)
A source has one or more authors through its recipes.
A source has many recipes (through recipes).
An author has many recipes (through recipes).


Author
- name: prolly do first and last fields and do a virtual full name
- is_profi: bool, opt, default true

Source
- source_type: personal collection, book, or website
- title: required if book or site, "[first_name]'s Personal Collection" if personal collection
- source_url: required if site

Category
- name and slug

Recipe
- title and slug
- source_id
- author_id (cuz sources can be aggregates like gbbo.com)
- category_id 


#### FE
Add Recipe Form - DELETED FOR NOW
- updates to choose Author from a select menu
	- if need to add new Author, that will be done somewhere else
- once Author selected, runs a query to load Author's sources
  - sources are also a select menu, adding sources will be done somewhere else
- I think it is possible to build a react component that could handle the author/source crud alongside the select, but will keep it simple for now

Recipe Detail Page
  - should show source information if present

Author Detail Page
  - shows full name
	- sites section with list of sites, then by category and recipe
	- books section with list of book titles, then by category and recipe
	- OR, could combine both lists and display with RecipeView

  - title of source if present
	- url of source if present
	- author(s) names
	- RecipeView with list or categories
