		{ qty: 100, unit: "ml", name: "lemon-juice", note: "2-3 lemons" },
		{ qty: 1, unit: "Tbsp", name: "lemon-zest", note: "take from 1/2 lemon before squeezing"},

	],
	steps: [
		"Grate the zest of half of one of the lemons",
		"Squeeze the lemons until you have 100ml lemon juice",
		"Put the lemon juice in a heatproof bowl and beat in the sugar and the eggs",
		"Heat the bowl au bain-marie by placing it on top of a saucepan containing a shallow layer of boiling water, ensuring the bowl does not touch the water, as it will burn the cream",
		"Cook the curd while stirring continuously until a candy thermometer reads 85C/185F and has thickened",
		"Remove the bowl from the heat and stir in the butter and zest",
		"Leave the curd to set in the fridge for at least 1 hr, or overnight",
		"When you're ready to use, mix the cream again until smooth",
		"Use a piping bag with a plain round 10-12mmm nozzle to pipe the cream into the tart bases",
		"Allow the tarts to set in the refrigerator"
	],
	notes: [
		"Use food coloring to enhance the color, add after stirring in the butter"
